            <h2> 1 . Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                What is lead generation? Do all persons who view advertisements of a particular brand become leads? No.
                A lead is nothing but developing interest of a person in a brand’s product by using advertisements.
                Since
                all
                viewers are not converted into leads, it becomes important for businesses to focus primarily on those
                customers
                that
                show interest in their product. This is something that is now being readily practiced by brands to be
                cost
                efficient
                and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                In today’s competitive era, it has become the need of the hour for brands to develop more captivating
                methods to
                record leads and create a loyal customer base. While the marketing industry itself has abundant
                traditional
                ways, it
                has become important for businesses to incorporate unique and interesting modes of marketing, one of
                which
                is
                branded marketing games, popularly known as lead generation games.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a mode of interactive and engaging advertising, lead generation games provide an amusing and
                fun-laden
                experience
                to customers while acquainting them about their favorite brands and their respective products. In the
                process,
                lead
                generation games use their tech to gather contact information of such customers, making it more
                convenient
                for
                the
                brand to reach out to them for future marketing. This not only makes it easy for brands to follow up on
                their
                customers but also to convert them into consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lead generation games can have multiple forms. For example, quizzes, giveaways, or even lotteries. While
                they
                may be
                distinctive in their methodology, what makes them common is that all are driven with the primary motive
                of
                being
                engaging and informative.
                <img

                Another advantage of event gamification over traditional forms of marketing is that while audio-visual
                advertisements tend to fade away quickly from the customer’s memory, these gamified methods of marketing
                leave a
                long-lasting impact in the minds of their viewers. This makes the customers more inquisitive about the
                brand,
                thus
                increasing brand awareness and generating more leads.
